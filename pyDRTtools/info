DRT transformation functionality from pyDRTtools. See: https://github.com/ciuccislab/pyDRTtools.
Note: Not created by me, but included because DRT functionality is based on the pyDRTtools implementation.
Some modifications have been made to reduce cvxpy solver print statements during large dataset transformation.
